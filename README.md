# Student_Portfolio

This directory is to show the website I created to use as my portfolio. This portfolio currently gives brief look into my experience and background, but will develop as I create more functions projects.


My website currently utilizes these languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

  

All of the code for my projects can be viewed through my Github repositories. I can be contacted through my website!
